        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Three things make this vegetarian lentil soup so good: caramelized onions, toasted tomato paste (it's easy!), and lots of carrots and celery. Make a big pot to have some now and save some for laterâ€”this soup is freezer friendly!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, finely diced</li>
            <li>3 stalks celery, finely diced</li>
            <li>3 carrots, peeled and finely diced</li>
            <li>2 cups (12 ounces) small green French lentils</li>
            <li>8 cups water or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 bunch kale, stemmed and thinly</li>sliced crosswise
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add celery and carrot. Cook for 7 - 10 minutes or until softened and the onion is sweet. Don't rush this step, it is key to the flavour base of the soup.</li>
            <li>Add all remaining ingredients except the lemon and salt. Stir.</li>
            <li>Increase heat and bring to simmer. Scoop scum on the surface off and discard (do this again during cooking if required). Place lid on and turn heat down to medium low. Simmer for 35 - 40 minutes or until lentils are soft.</li>
            <li>Remove bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Thicken Soup: Using a stick blender, do 2 or 3 quick whizzes to thicken the soup (see video below). Or transfer 2 cups to a blender, let it cool slightly, then hold lid with tea towel and blend then transfer back into pot.</li>
            <li>Add a touch of water if you want to adjust soup consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Grate over the zest of the lemon then add a squeeze of lemon juice just before serving. Garnish with parsley if desired and serve with warm crusty bread slathered liberally with butter!</li>
        </ol>
