        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These oven baked sweet potato fries are so addictive! Wedges of sweet potatoes, tossed with oil, sprinkled with spices, and baked at high heat until browned and crispy at the edges.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds orange fleshed sweet potatoes (about 3 large)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons spice or spice combination of your choice: chipotle powder, smoked paprika, Chinese five-spice, pumpkin pie spice, garam masala, Cajun seasoning, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450°F. (For more crispiness, preheat your oven to 500°F.) Place a roasting pan or heavy duty baking sheet (one that can take high heat) in the oven to preheat.</li>
            
            <li>Peel the sweet potatoes and cut off the ends. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and then, if they are very long, in half crosswise. Cut each piece into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick wedges. Alternately, you can slice the peeled sweet potato into disks either with a mandoline or a sharp knife.</li>
            
            <li>Put the sweet potatoes into a large bowl and add the oil. Mix well to combine. Sprinkle with salt and spices of your choice. Use your hands to mix well, so all pieces are coated with oil and spices.</li>
            
            <li>Remove the preheated baking sheet from the oven. Carefully spread the sweet potatoes out in a single layer on the baking sheet. (Watch out, the pan is hot!)</li>
            
            <li>Bake for 15 to 25 minutes. After the first 10 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and use tongs to turn over all of the sweet potato pieces.</li>
            
            <li>Return to the oven and bake for another 5 to 15 minutes, or until they are well browned.</li>
            
            <li>When ready let the fries cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
